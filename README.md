# EEGBrainDynamicalApproach
Some dynamical approaches on classifying EEG-Alcohol dataset using EEGNet.

Dataset: EEG-Alcohol

What we can check from the ipynb
1. Using Taken's Embedding to visualize the difference of EEG signal by channel in each trial.
2. Possibility of channel reduction using sample entropy ratio in classification using EEGNet
